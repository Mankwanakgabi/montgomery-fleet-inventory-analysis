Montgomery Fleet Inventory Analysis

After the data was cleaned and prepared, pivot tables were created to analyze the fleet by department and equipment class. 

The analysis helps provide insights into the distribution of equipment across different departments.

Key Steps:

Data Cleaning: The original dataset was cleaned by removing empty rows, correcting department names, and fixing formatting issues.

Pivot Table Analysis: Pivot tables were created to summarize equipment counts by department and equipment class.

Data Insights: The analysis provided a clear breakdown of equipment distribution, which can be used for reporting and decision-making.

Tools Used:
